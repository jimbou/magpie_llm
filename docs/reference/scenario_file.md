# Configuration File

Magpie's default entry points require a scenario file in the [INI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file).
Examples of such files can be found in the `examples/scenario` folder.
We detail in the following the different section, properties, and default values used by Magpie.


## `[magpie]`

Default values:

    [magpie]
    import =
    seed =
    log_dir = '_magpie_logs'
    work_dir = '_magpie_work'
    local_original_copy = False
    local_original_name = '__original__'
    output_encoding = 'ascii'
    edit_retries = 10
    default_timeout = 30
    default_lengthout = 1e4
    diff_method = 'unified'
    trust_local_filesystem = True

- `import`: the path of an optional Python file to import
- `seed`: a random seed
- `log_dir`: the folder in which logs, diffs, and patches are saved after execution
- `work_dir`: the folder in which mutated software variants are cloned, modified, compiled, and run
- `local_original_copy`: whether an intermediary copy of the original software is also cloned in `work_dir` (useful e.g. in cluster to clone everything in `/tmp`.
- `local_original_name`: the name of the intermerdiary copy in `work_dir` (only if `local_original_copy` is `True`)
- `output_encoding`: the character encoding used to decode the target software's stdout/stderr
- `edit_retries`: how many invalid edits Magpie tries to generate in a row before completely giving up.
- `default_timeout`: maximum execution time Magpie waits before discarding a software variant (used if `init_timeout`, `setup_timeout`, `compile_timeout`, `test_timeout`, or `run_timeout` is not specified in `[software]`)
- `default_lengthout`: maximum output file size Magpie records before discarding a software variant (used if `init_lengthout`, `setup_lengthout`, `compile_lengthout`, `test_lengthout`, or `run_lengthout` is not specified in `[software]`). Set to a negative value (e.g., `-1`) for unlimited output.
- `diff_method`: type of diff format (either ["unified"](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Example-Unified.html) or ["context"](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Example-Context.html))
- `trust_local_filesystem`: when the processed (i.e., after parsing and dump) version of an unmodified file is different to the one currently on disk, trusts that it is indeed semantically equivalent; otherwise, overwrite it. (useful to preserve incremental compilation)


## `[magpie.log]`

Default values:

    [magpie.log]
    color_output = True
    format_info = {counter:<7} {status:<20} {best}{fitness} ({ratio}) [{size}] {cached} {log}

    format_fitness = {:.2f}
    format_ratio = {:.2%%}
    format_patchif = \n --> {patch}
    format_diffif = \n{diff}

- `color_output`: colourise Magpie's output in the terminal
- `format_info`: the [format string](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) used every evaluation, show both in the terminal and file logs; available keys include `counter` (e.g., "WARM" during warmup, or the variant index), `status` (e.g., "SUCCESS" or "COMPILE\_CODE\_ERROR"), `best` (a single character: "*" when the best fitness value so far is improved, "+" for repeated best fitness values, " " otherwise), `fitness` (one or more fitness values, formatted using `format_fitness`), `ratio` (likewise, for ratios using the reference fitness value), `size` (the number of edits of the related patch), `cached` (either the string "[cached]" when the evaluation was bypassed, "[part.cached]" when using instance batches when only some were cached, empty otherwise), `patch`, `patchifaccept`, `patchifbest`, `diff`, `diffifaccept`, `diffifbest`, (formatted when necessary with `format_patchif` and `format_diffif`), and `log` (for additional data reported by the search algorithm)
- `format_debug`: similar to `format_info`, but only used in file logs
- `format_fitness`: the format string used when formatting fitness values
- `format_ratio`: the format string used when formatting fitness values _ratios_
- `format_patchif`: the format string used when formatting `patchifaccept` and `patchifbest`
- `format_diffif`: the format string used when formatting `diffifaccept` and `diffifbest`

- `software`: the name of the Software class; it needs to belong to `magpie.bin.softwares`
- `model_rules`: the list of rules used to determine how target files are internally represented; model classes need to belong to `magpie.models.known_models`
- `model_config`: the list of rules used to determine which section of the scenario file gets used to configure the model of the associated files
- `possible_edits`: the list of edits available to the search process; they need to belong to `magpie.models.known_edits`
- `init_cmd`: command line to execute during the init step (or "", in which case it is skipped)
- `init_timeout`: maximum execution time during the init step (or "", in which case `default_timeout` from `[magpie]` is used)
- `init_lengthout`: maximum output file size during the init step (or "", in which case `default_lengthout` from `[magpie]` is used)
- `setup_cmd`: same but for the setup step

- `batch_fitness_strategy`: the population parameter for bin fitness values (possible: `sum`, `average`, `median`)

Note that both `target_files` and `possible edits` lists are newline-separated; the first line (after the `=`) may be empty, any subsequent line must start with a space.
Typical examples:

    possible_edits =
        LineReplacement
        LineInsertion
        LineDeletion

    possible_edits = ParamSetting


### `[srcml]`

Default values:

    [srcml]
    rename =
        stmt: break continue decl_stmt do expr_stmt for goto if return switch while

    focus = block stmt operator_comp operator_arith number
    internodes = block
    process_pseudo_blocks = True
    process_literals = True
    process_operators = True

- `rename`: a multi-line dictionary of renaming rules.
  E.g., all `<break>` and `<continue>` tags will be renamed `<stmt>`.
  This is to ensures consistency, as Magpie's default edits only apply to identical XML tags.
- `focus`: the list of tags to keep in the file (all other tags are internally discarded)
- `internodes`: a list of tags to process for future node insertion.
  E.g., `internodes = block` will create the `_inter_block` insertion points.
- `process_pseudo_blocks`: automatically inserts curly braces around otherwise braceless blocks
  (e.g., single-line if statement).
- `process_literals`: rename `<literal>` tags according to their `type` attribute.
  E.g., `<literal type="number">' to `<literal_number>`.
- `process_operators`: rename `<operator>` tags into `<operator_comp>`, `<operator_arith>` or `<operator_misc>` according to their text contents.


### `[paramconfig]`

Default values:

    [paramconfig]
    timing = run
    cli_prefix = "--"
    cli_glue = "="
    cli_boolean = "show" # show ; hide ; prefix
    cli_boolean_prefix_true = ""

- `batch_instances`: a newline-separated list of "instances" to be used together with `run_cmd`, either replacing the string "{INST}" or appended at the end of the command. Can be left empty to disable batch sampling. Use "___" to separate bins of instances. Use "file:xxx" to append all lines from the file "xxx".
- `batch_shuffle`: whether the order of instances should be randomised

### `[search.minify]`

Minifier parameters:

    do_cleanup = True
    do_rebuild = True

- `do_rebuild`: ranks every individual edits and reinsert following fitness order
- `do_simplify`: removes individual edits from the best patch (round robin exploration)
- `round_robin_limit`: maximum number of times edits can be considered during the simplification step (use `-1` to disable)
